# Applied Data Science Capstone
This is a repository for [the Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) project offered by IBM and Coursera. This repository hosts the Notebooks and a Python file that I have worked on to run and complete the project. Huge thanks to IBM and Coursera for providing this learning opportunity.

Notebook6 has Folium interactive maps. The maps are not displayed even if the notebook is configured as trusted. To see the interactive map, please refer to [this link](https://nbviewer.org/github/jungkees/IBM-data-science-capstone/blob/main/Notebook6_Launch_Site_Locations_Analysis.ipynb).
